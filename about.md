This is a blog I have started writing about kaggle. By day, I work at University College London, managing research data for a major UK longitudinal study. But I also have a keen interest in finding out more about data science and machine learning. I have taken a few online courses, read some books, worked on a few projects, but I have decided to start trying out a few kaggle competitoins to sharpen the skills that I've "kinda" picked up over the years and hopefully learn some new ones.

None of this, to be honest, is directly relevant to my job at the moment. But I hope that kaggle will also help me to code cleanly, professionally and efficently - which is highly relevant to my current job and any job I'm likely to do in the future.

The hope is to write a few pages here about each project I do, an explanation of the code I use, the methods I use and the ways I evaluate what I've done. For now, any code I come up with will be available on my github repository.
